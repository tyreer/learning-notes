# Learning Notes

Markdown notes from web dev books and courses

These notes generally aren't comprehensive as much as a set of highlights that I've selected as relevant to my own learning. 

Highly possible that they're relevant to you too!

Taking notes like this is motivated by my experience an educator who appreciated [disfluency theory](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2018.00101/full), which you can think of as adding friction to a learning process in order to better build understanding.
