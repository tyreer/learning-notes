### Key concepts
+ Reducer composition
  + combineReducers({})
+ Distinction between container and presentational components
+ mapDispatchToProps()

### Questions
+ Why is connect being used in so many places?
+ Just because there are many more container components than Treehouse tutorial?
+ Why is _mapDispatchToProps_ not a part of the Treehouse tutorial?
_Map out he data flow of this app just like the Treehouse one to think through_

```JavaScript
connect(
  mapStateProps,
  mapDispatchProps
  ```

##### Dependencies
+ __deepFreeze__ is being used to ensure no mutations and therefor pure functions
+ Michael Jackson's __expect__ package. which seems to be folded into __Jest__ now, is used for __assertion testing__

```JavaScript
const counter = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1;
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```
+ __If initial state is undefined, we must define what we expect the default state to be__. In this case __state = 0__ sets a sensible initial state for the counter.
+ The final __default case__ in a reducer (here _counter_) handles an unknown action type by simply returning existing state
+ https://github.com/tayiorbeii/egghead.io_redux_course_notes/blob/master/02-Reducer_and_Store.md#05-writing-a-counter-reducer-with-tests

```JavaScript
const removeCounter = (list, index) => {
  //  (Pre-ES6)
  //  return list
  //  .slice(0, index)
  //  .concat(list.slice(index + 1));

  //  (ES6)
  return [
    ...list.slice(0, index),
    ...list.slice(index + 1)
  ];
};
```
+ Two spread operators with a comma replicates _concat_ between two arrays

Egghead:
```JavaScript
const incrementCounter = (list, index) => {
  return [
    ...list.slice(0, index),
    list[index] + 1,
    ...list.slice(index + 1)
  ];
};
```

Treehouse:
```JavaScript
case PlayerActionTypes.UPDATE_PLAYER_SCORE: {
   const updatedPlayerList = state.players.map((player, index) => {
     if(index === action.index) {
       return {
         ...player,
         score: player.score + action.score,
         updated: `${month}/${day}/${year}`
       };
     }
     return player;
   });
   return {
     ...state,
     players: updatedPlayerList
   };
 }
```

+ To update a value at an index, Egghead tutorial uses __spread + slice__, while Treehouse uses __map + match__
+ In Video 12 TOGGLE_TODO uses the _map + match_ as well
+ https://github.com/tayiorbeii/egghead.io_redux_course_notes/blob/master/05-Avoiding_Array_Mutations.md#09-avoiding-array-mutations

```JavaScript
const toggleTodo = (todo) => {
  return Object.assign({}, todo, {
    completed: !todo.completed
  });
};
```

```JavaScript
const toggleTodo = (todo) => {
  return {
    ...todo,
      completed: !todo.completed
  };
};
```
+ Both of the above do the same, but the __object spread__ syntax on the bottom is clearly preferable
+ Object spread is used in Treehouse tutorial because they have stage: 0 Babel config
+ _Object rest spread transform_ is stage 3 in January 18
+ https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-object-rest-spread/
https://github.com/tayiorbeii/egghead.io_redux_course_notes/blob/master/06-Avoiding_Object_Mutations.md

```JavaScript
{
  "presets": ["react", "es2015", "stage-0"]
}
```
+ __stage-0__ _.babelrc_ preset includes stages 1â€“3


### 11. Writing a Todo List Reducer (Adding a Todo)
```JavaScript
const todos = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return [
        ...state,
        {
          id: action.id,
          text: action.text,
          completed: false
        }
      ];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const testAddTodo = () => {
  const stateBefore = [];
  const action = {
      type: 'ADD_TODO',
      id: 0,
      text: 'Learn Redux'
  };
  const stateAfter = [{
      id: 0,
      text: 'Learn Redux',
      completed: false
  }];

  deepFreeze(stateBefore);
  deepFreeze(action);

  expect(
    todos(stateBefore, action)
  ).toEqual(stateAfter);
};

testAddTodo();
console.log('All tests passed')
```
+ Interesting to see all this in a single file
+ __reducer__ function here is a nice simple example of passing in initial state and an action and returning modified state

### 13. Reducer Composition with Arrays

+ To model __reducer composition__, the course breaks out reducers into:
  + one that handles changes to state of individual to do items
  + one that handles changes to state in to do list
+ This is different than the Treehouse course, where state is managed for both the individual player and the players list array in one reducer

https://github.com/tayiorbeii/egghead.io_redux_course_notes/blob/master/08-Reducer_Composition_with_Arrays.md

### 14. Reducer Composition with Objects

+ A further model of __reducer composition__, this time with an independent reducer for each part of the application state object
+ Application state tree is very similar to Treehouse course at this point (array + string)
+ But the use of reducer composition is very different to the Treehouse course

  >What we've just done is a common Redux practice called reducer composition. Different reducers specify how different parts of the state tree are updated in response to actions. Since reducers are normal JS functions, they can call other reducers to delegate & abstract away updates to the state.
Reducer composition can be applied many times. While there's a single top-level reducer managing the overall state of the app, __it's encouraged to have reducers call each other__ as needed to manage the state tree.

  > __This pattern helps to scale Redux development__, since different team members can work on different reducers that work with the same actions, without stepping on each other's toes.


```JavaScript
const todoApp = (state = {}, action) => {
  return {
     todos: todos(
      state.todos,
      action
    ),
    visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(
      state.visibilityFilter,
      action
    )
  };
};
```
+ Application reducer, _todoApp_, combines _todos_ and _visibilityFilter_ reducers
+ Initial state in this case ends up being defined by the default values in the child reducer arguments
  + const visibilityFilter = (__state = 'SHOW_ALL'__, action) => {}

```JavaScript
const todos = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return [
        ...state,
        todo(undefined, action)
      ];
    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
      return state.map(t => todo(t, action));
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```
+ This reducer handles the _todos_ array and uses the _todo_ reducer to call for updated state for individual items
+ __Reducer composition__

```JavaScript
const visibilityFilter = (state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER':
        return action.filter;
      default:
        return state;
    }
};
```
+ This reducer is super simple and is just updating the string value for _visibilityFilter_


https://github.com/tayiorbeii/egghead.io_redux_course_notes/blob/master/09-Reducer_Composition_with_Objects.md

### 15. Reducer Composition with combineReducers()

```JavaScript
import { combineReducers } from 'react-redux';
const todoApp = combineReducers({
  todos,
  visibilityFilter
});
```
+ The previous section's top level reducer declaration can be replaced with much convenient utility function __combineReducers()__
+ The only argument to combineReducers() is an object that specifies the mapping between the state field names and the reducers that manage them.
  + In this example, the state field names and their reducers have the same name, so we can reduce _todos: todos_ to a single reference

### 16. Implementing combineReducers() from Scratch
>It's important to understand __functional programming__. Functions can take other functions as arguments, and return other functions. Knowing this will increase productivity with Redux in the long term.

+ https://github.com/tayiorbeii/egghead.io_redux_course_notes/blob/master/11-Implementing_combineReducers_from_Scratch.md

### 17.
```JavaScript
<input ref={node => {
  this.input = node;
}} />
<button onClick={() => {
  store.dispatch({
    type: 'ADD_TODO',
    text: this.input.value,
    id: nextTodoId++
  });
  this.input.value = '';
}}>
```

+ Course uses __ref callback on input element__ rather than managing local state as a logical presentational component. This is different than the Treehouse course, but also seems to be somewhat common as a way to handle local state on an input.
>We'll use React's callback __ref()__ API. ref() is a function that gets the node corresponding to the ref, which we'll save with the name _this.input_

### 19. Filtering todos

```JavaScript
const FilterLink = ({
  filter,
  currentFilter,
  children
}) => {
  if (filter === currentFilter) {
    return <span>{children}</span>
  }
  return (
    <a href='#'
       onClick={e => {
         e.preventDefault();
         store.dispatch({
           type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',
           filter
         });
       }}
    >
      {children}
    </a>
  )
}
```
+ Presentational/functional component that dispatches an action
+ __const FilterLink = ({filter, children}) => {...}__ destructuring the _filter_ and _children_ props here allows them to be used within the component without something like _props.filter_
+ __{children}__ allows _consumer_ to insert their own text inside anchor
+ Inline onClick function isn't the clearest to me. Weird because it's not reusable if we wanted to dispatch that action on another element.
  + I prefer the bound action creators from Treehouse tutorial


```JavaScript
//In TodoApp component
<p>
  Show:
  {' '}
  <FilterLink
    filter='SHOW_ALL'
    currentFilter={visibilityFilter}
  >
    All
  </FilterLink>
  {' '}
  <FilterLink
    filter='SHOW_ACTIVE'
    currentFilter={visibilityFilter}
  >
    Active
  </FilterLink>
  {' '}
  <FilterLink
    filter='SHOW_COMPLETED'
    currentFilter={visibilityFilter}
  >
    Completed
  </FilterLink>
</p>
.
```
+ Using _FilterLink_ several times in app and setting the metadata value via _filter_ prop for the unnamed action dispatched by onClick in FilterLink

```JavaScript
const getVisibleTodos = (
  todos,
  filter
) => {
  switch (filter) {
    case 'SHOW_ALL':
      return todos;
    case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':
      return todos.filter(
        t => t.completed
      );
    case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':
      return todos.filter(
        t => !t.completed
      );
  }
}
```
+ Reducer for filtering todos

```JavaScript
class TodoApp extends Component {
  render() {
    const {
      todos,
      visibilityFilter
    } = this.props;
    const visibleTodos = getVisibleTodos(
      todos,
      visibilityFilter
    );
    return (
  ```
+ __visibleTodos__ is what gets rendered inside the UL

### 22. Extracting Container Components (FilterLink)

__Refactoring FilterLink to extract Link as a presentational component__

>Inside of the FilterLink definition, we don't currently specify behavior for clicking on the link. It also needs to know the current filter so it can render the item appropriately. Because of this, __we can't say FilterLink is presentational, because it is inseparable from its behavior__. The only reasonable behavior is to dispatch an action (SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER) upon clicking. This is __an opportunity to split this into a more concise presentational component, with a wrapping container component to manage the logic and the presentational component being used for rendering__.
Therefore, we will start by converting our current FilterLink into a presentational component called Link.
The new Link presentational component doesn't know anything about the filter-- it only accepts the active prop, and calls its onClick handler. Link is only concerned with rendering.
Therefore, we will start by converting our current FilterLink into a presentational component called Link.

```JavaScript
const Link = ({
  active,
  children,
  onClick
}) => {
  if (active) {
    return <span>{children}</span>
  }

  return (
    <a href='#'
      onClick={e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        onClick();
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </a>
  );
};
```
+ Interesting that _Link_ is literally just an element (span or anchor) with some attributes
+ __Presentational component__ here is just markup

```JavaScript
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
  active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter
})

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({
  onClick: () => {
    dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter))
  }
})

const FilterLink = connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(Link)
```
>As a __container component__, FilterLink doesn't have its own markup, and it delegates rendering to the Link presentational component.
In this case, it calculates its active prop by comparing its own filter prop with the visibilityFilter in the Redux store's state.

>The container component also needs to specify the behavior. In this case, the FilterLink specifies that when a particular Link is clicked, we should dispatch an action of the type 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER' along with the filter value that we take from the props.

>Remember, the job of all container components is similar: __connect a presentational component to the Redux store + specify the data and behavior that it needs__.

+ __connect() injects dispatch() as a prop__ coming from the store

### 23. Extracting Container Components (VisibleTodoList, AddTodo)

+ Good recap of the app once container and presentational components are separated out
+ _Footer_ is a presentational component with a child container component in _FilterLink_, which itself has a child presentational component of _Link_
+ Principle of separating container and presentational components is to make data flow clear.
+ Advisable, but __not a pattern that needs to be followed dogmatically__ if it doesn't achieve that aim

### 27. Generating Containers with connect() from React Redux (VisibleTodoList)

```JavaScript
const getVisibleTodos = (todos, filter) => {
  switch (filter) {
    case 'SHOW_ALL':
      return todos
    case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':
      return todos.filter(t => t.completed)
    case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':
      return todos.filter(t => !t.completed)
    default:
      throw new Error('Unknown filter: ' + filter)
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter)
})

const mapDispatchToProps = {
  onTodoClick: toggleTodo
}

const VisibleTodoList = connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(TodoList)
```

> The result of the __connect__ call is the container component (_VisibleTodoList_) that is going to render the presentational component(_TodoList_)

+ __connect() generates container components__

> __mapStateToProps__ maps the Redux store's state to the props of the TodoList component that are related to the data from the Redux store. These props will be updated any time the state changes

> __mapDispatchToProps__ maps the store's dispatch() method and returns the props that use the dispatch method to dispatch actions. So it returns the callback props needed by the presentational component. It specifies the behavior of which callback prop dispatches which action.

### 28. Generating Containers with connect() from React Redux (AddTodo)
```JavaScript
let AddTodo = ({ dispatch }) => {
  let input

  return (
    <div>
      <form onSubmit={e => {
        e.preventDefault()
        if (!input.value.trim()) {
          return
        }
        dispatch(addTodo(input.value))
        input.value = ''
      }}>
        <input ref={node => {
          input = node
        }} />
        <button type="submit">
          Add Todo
        </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  )
}
AddTodo = connect()(AddTodo)
```
+ We use _let_ to declare the component because the second _connect_ call (the second pair of parenthesis in the curried function) generates a container component and assigns it to _AddTodo_ (basically overriding the earlier declaration or _reassigning the let binding_)

```JavaScript
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <AddTodo />
    <VisibleTodoList />
    <Footer />
  </div>
)
```
+ The _App_ component then is rendering the container component (the reassigned component that's exported), which passes dispatch into its internal presentational component (...weird)

### 29. Generating Containers with connect() from React Redux (FooterLink)

```JavaScript
const Footer = () => (
  <p>
    Show:
    {" "}
    <FilterLink filter="SHOW_ALL">
      All
    </FilterLink>
    {", "}
    <FilterLink filter="SHOW_ACTIVE">
      Active
    </FilterLink>
    {", "}
    <FilterLink filter="SHOW_COMPLETED">
      Completed
    </FilterLink>
  </p>
)
```
```JavaScript
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
  active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter
})
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({
  onClick: () => {
    dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter))
  }
})
const FilterLink = connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(Link)
```
```JavaScript
const Link = ({ active, children, onClick }) => {
  if (active) {
    return <span>{children}</span>
  }
  return (
    // eslint-disable-next-line
    <a href="#"
       onClick={e => {
         e.preventDefault()
         onClick()
       }}
    >
      {children}
    </a>
  )
}
Link.propTypes = {
  active: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,
  children: PropTypes.node.isRequired,
  onClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired
}
```

+ Good __model of relationships between components__: _Footer_ -> _FilterLink_ -> _Link_

### 30. Extracting Action Creators

```JavaScript
let nextTodoId = 0
export const addTodo = (text) => ({
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  id: nextTodoId++,
  text
})

export const setVisibilityFilter = (filter) => ({
  type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',
  filter
})

export const toggleTodo = (id) => ({
  type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',
  id
})
```
> __addTodo__ is only passed is the text of the todo being added. We don't want to generate the id inside of the reducer because that would make it __non-deterministic__.

+ Action Creators document the software for others on the team
