# Notes from the [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/the-phoenix-project/)

## Main takeaways from memory:

- The lessons learned from the history of industrial manufacturing should be applied to software production
- "constraints" - nothing in your system of work will move faster than the bottleneck
  - So focus on increasing throughput at the bottleneck
  - Importance of prioritization and shielding from distraction
- Visualizing work and its flow, including wait time

_Five Dysfunctions of Team_

> In order to have mutual trust, you need to be vulnerable

- Reminds me of [The five keys to a successful Google team](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/)

> Of those Google teams, the ones that adopted a new group norm -- like kicking off every team meeting by sharing a risk taken in the previous week -- improved 6% on psychological safety ratings and 10% on structure and clarity ratings.

- p. 212: Good couple pages of Erik wisdom
  - Main idea is that a monitoring or maintenance project becomes a clear priority and some other ostensibly critical work can be seen as smart to hold off doing
  - _Total Productive Maintenance_ : we do whatever it takes to assure machine availability by elevating maintenance

> Mike Rother says that it almost doesn't matter what you improve, as along as you're improving something. Why? Because ig you are not improving, entropy guarantees that you are actually getting worse, which ensure that there is no path to zero errors, zero work-related accidents, and zero loss."

- Kata because if you want to create a culture of improvement, you must create habits
- Point about wait time and managing handoffs
  - Proportion of busy/idle time
  - 50/50 = 1
  - 90/10 = 9
  - If someone is very busy, the wait time for them to pick up will be much longer, meaning throughput lags as work stacks up in queues
- Key idea to **make wait time visible**

  - Reminds me of the _Lean from the Trenches_ text and the kanban boards with clear queues that could contain limited numbers of ticket

- p. 296: Small batch sizes

- _single-minute exchange of die_ is a cool phrase
  - Toyota process improvement that took a 3-day process of changing a hood stamp die down to under 10 minutes
- _Takt time_ = cycle time needed to keep up with customer demand

  - Large batches can lead to inability to produce in a timely enough way to meet customer demand
